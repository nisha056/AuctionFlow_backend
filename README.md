This is the backend part of my AuctionFlow app where the users can make online bidding to the product.
It is written using express and for database mongoDB is used.
There are two models: one for the user and another for the product.
For user, authentication system is implemented and only the verified user can get access of the app.
For product, one can add the product, view details about product, like the product , bid the product and amny more.
